# 🌍 Urban Air Quality and Climate Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing **urban air quality and climate data** to explore trends, correlations, and insights over the past decade. The goal is to understand how environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and pollutants influence urban air quality and overall climate conditions.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains historical data on:

* **Air Quality Indicators**: CO, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, PM2.5, PM10
* **Climate Variables**: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Precipitation
* **Time Period**: Last 10 years
* **Geographical Scope**: Urban areas

Formats used:

* **CSV** for structured data analysis
* **JSON** for metadata and hierarchical attributes
